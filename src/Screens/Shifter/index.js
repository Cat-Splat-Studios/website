          <p>
            In the year 21XX our galaxy is invaded by a powerful species, the
            Agonians. Having drained their own world of the most valuable
            resource, water, they now seek out planets rich with it, and destroy
            all intelligent life in the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Galactic Alliance has been pushed to the brink. The last hope
            lies with a secret project that has combined all the Alliance
            ingenuity and technology with a power source from one of the
            defeated alien spacecraft. Theyâ€™ve designated this project the
            Codename: Shifter.
